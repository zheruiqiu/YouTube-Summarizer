## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 15.x or higher (for local installation)
- npm package manager (for local installation)
- Docker (optional, for containerized installation)
- API keys for the AI services

### Installation

#### Option 1: Local Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd youtube-summarizer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
# You only need to add the API keys for the models you want to use
# At least one API key is required
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-deepseek-api-key"
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```

4. Set up the database:
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

#### Option 2: Docker Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd youtube-summarizer
```

2. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t youtube-summarizer .
```

3. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ./prisma:/app/prisma \
  -e DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-key" \
  -e GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key" \
  -e GROQ_API_KEY="your-key" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key" \
  youtube-summarizer
```

Note for Docker installation:
- The `-v ./prisma:/app/prisma` flag creates a volume for the SQLite database
- You only need to provide the API keys for the models you want to use
- At least one API key is required
- The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üîß Configuration

### API Key Configuration

The application is designed to work with partial API key configurations:

- You only need to provide API keys for the models you want to use
- The UI will automatically show which models are available based on your API keys
- You can start with just one API key and add more later
- Models without API keys will be disabled in the interface

### Database Setup
The application uses Prisma with SQLite for data persistence. The configuration is defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`:
```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:./dev.db"
}
```

To reset the database if you encounter any issues:
```bash
# Remove the existing database
rm prisma/dev.db
# Regenerate the database
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Database Issues

If you encounter database errors like "database disk image is malformed", follow these steps:

1. Stop the development server
2. Delete the corrupted database:
   ```bash
   rm prisma/dev.db
   ```
3. Regenerate the database:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   ```
4. Restart the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### API Errors

If you encounter API errors:

1. Check that all environment variables are properly set in `.env`
2. Verify that your API keys are valid and have sufficient credits
3. For history-related errors, try resetting the database as described above

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid API Key" errors**:
   - Double-check your API keys in `.env`
   - Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes
   - Verify the keys are active in their respective platforms

2. **"Failed to fetch summaries" error**:
   - Usually indicates a database issue
   - Follow the database reset steps above
   - Check if your database has proper read/write permissions

3. **Performance issues**:
   - Long videos may take more time to process
   - Consider using Gemini model for faster processing
   - Check your network connection
